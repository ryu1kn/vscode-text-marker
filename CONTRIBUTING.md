# How to Contribute

## Setting up dev environment

### Prerequisites

* Node.js version specified in [.nvmrc](./.nvmrc)
* Yarn for package manager: https://yarnpkg.com/

### Setup

```sh
yarn install
```

## Development

I'd love to see that tests are written to confirm the new behaviours.

You can run all checks (linting & testing) with `yarn run check`.

## Build

You can check what CI is checking at [.travis.yml](./.travis.yml).
